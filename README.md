## Ground Truth Data Collection

`start2park` is a mobile app that collects ground truth data on parking search. 
The functionality of the app is intentionally easy. 
The main screen of the app can be seen in the image below.

In four steps, we collect the time and location of 1) origin of the journey, 2) the starting point 
of the search, 3) the parking spot, and 4) the final walking destination. A sample journey
recorded by start2park app can be seen in the image below:
